# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Stream Text Detector is a Go CLI application that monitors live video streams (RTSP/HTTP) for specific text content using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It uses OpenCV for video processing and Tesseract for OCR, with a concurrent pipeline architecture for real-time frame processing.

## Build and Development Commands

### Dependencies
```bash
make deps          # Download and verify dependencies
make deps-update   # Update all dependencies
```

### Building
```bash
make build         # Build binary with OpenCV support
make build-all     # Cross-compile for Linux, Windows, macOS
go build -o std .  # Direct build command
```

### Testing
```bash
make test          # Run tests (requires OpenCV and Tesseract)
make test-coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Running
```bash
make run ARGS="-url rtsp://example.com -word BREAKING"
./std -url rtsp://example.com -word "BREAKING,URGENT" -interval 2s
```

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **main.go**: CLI entry point with flag parsing and graceful shutdown
- **detector.go**: Optimized detection engine with high-performance concurrent pipeline:
  - Frame capture goroutine (captures at intervals with backpressure)
  - OCR Worker Pool (2x CPU cores workers for parallel Tesseract processing)
  - Result logging goroutine (logs matches with structured output)
  - Performance monitoring goroutine (tracks metrics and resource utilization)

### Build Configuration
All code now requires OpenCV and Tesseract to be installed on the system. The build tag separation has been removed for simplicity.

### Key Types
- `Config`: CLI configuration parsed from flags
- `Detector`: High-performance processing engine with worker pool management
- `OCRWorker`: Individual worker with dedicated Tesseract client
- `OCRWorkerPool`: Pool manager for coordinating parallel OCR processing
- `Frame`: Video frame with metadata (index, timestamp)
- `DetectionResult`: OCR results with confidence and word matches
- `StreamMetrics`: Enhanced metrics tracking performance and resource utilization

### Dependencies
- `gocv.io/x/gocv`: OpenCV Go bindings for video processing
- `github.com/otiai10/gosseract/v2`: Tesseract OCR wrapper

### Performance Targets (Optimized)
- Memory: 500MB-1GB RAM for 1080p streams (dynamic based on worker count)
- CPU: Multi-core utilization (2x CPU cores for optimal throughput)
- Throughput: 5-15 fps processing capability depending on hardware
- Latency: <200ms average OCR processing time per frame
- Accuracy: â‰¥95% precision/recall on broadcast captions
- Buffer efficiency: 70% backpressure threshold with dynamic sizing

## System Requirements

The application requires OpenCV 4.x with FFmpeg support and Tesseract OCR 5.x to be installed on the system before building or running. See README.md for platform-specific installation instructions.
